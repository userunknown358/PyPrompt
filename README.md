# PyPrompt
A text based Py Operating System in one small file

**Note from the developer**
I am not good at Python, so expect a LOT of bugs. I will be using ChatGPT for debugging sometimes, Thank you! Also make sure you use a program that doesn't use command prompt or else it will close when a program is closed

**Requirements:**
You must have Python installed and that's about it!

**To-do List:**
Error messages as message boxes

**Bugs:**
When opening a program, the OS will load all programs. This may be fixed soon.
